# Introduction
Stripe is a popular payment gateway that enables businesses to accept payments online. One of the fundamental aspects of Stripe is the tokenization process, where sensitive credit card information is securely converted into a token that can be used for payment transactions. Stripe Auto-Strike helps you automate this process and understand how it works.

By using this script, you can:

- Simulate the tokenization process for credit card transactions.
- Gain insights into how Stripe handles credit card, users and transactions data.
- Experiment with Stripe's API using your demo secret key.
- Explore transaction mapping and retrieve essential details.

# Prerequisites & Installations
## Before using Stripe Auto-Strike, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

Stripe Account: You should have a Stripe account and a demo secret key. You can obtain these by signing up at Stripe.

Python: This script is written in Python. You need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from Python's official website.

Stripe Python Library: Install the Stripe Python library using pip:

```bash
pip install stripe
```
# Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/CyberDemon73/Stripe-Auto-Strike.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Stripe-Auto-Strike
```
Open the Stripe_auto_strike.py file and replace 'your_secret_key_here' with your actual demo secret key obtained from your Stripe account.

# Usage
After completing the installation steps and configuring your secret key, you can use Stripe Auto-Strike as follows:

Run the script:

```bash
python stripe_auto_strike.py
```
The script will guide you through the tokenization process, simulate transactions, and provide details about each step.

You can experiment with different credit card details provided in the Stripe documentation to understand how Stripe handles them.

Explore the code to gain a deeper understanding of the Stripe API interactions and transaction mapping.

# Stripe Additional Knowledge
## Stripe API Keys

Stripe uses two types of API keys for different purposes: **public keys** and **secret keys**. These keys are essential for integrating Stripe into your application.

### Public Key

The **public key** is used for client-side operations, such as creating tokens for secure handling of payment information. It is safe to expose this key in your frontend code as it cannot perform sensitive actions on your Stripe account. You can obtain your public key from your Stripe dashboard.

### Secret Key

The **secret key** is used for server-side operations and carries sensitive privileges. There are two main types of secret keys:

1. **Demo Secret Key**: This key is used for testing and development purposes. It allows you to simulate transactions and interactions with the Stripe API without making actual charges to credit cards. It's essential to keep this key secure, but it should not be used in production environments.

2. **Live Secret Key**: This key is used in a production environment to process real transactions. It should be kept extremely secure since it has the power to initiate charges and perform actions that affect your actual Stripe account and your users' financial data.

**Note**: Never expose your secret keys in client-side code or public repositories, as it poses a significant security risk.

For more information on managing your Stripe API keys, refer to the Stripe documentation.

Remember to use the appropriate key for the specific context (development or production) and follow best practices for securing your secret keys.
